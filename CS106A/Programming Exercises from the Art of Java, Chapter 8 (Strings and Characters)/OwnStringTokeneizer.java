 * Even though the StringTokenizer class is already part of the java.util package, you can learn a great deal about both string 
 * manipulation and class design by reimplementing StringTokenizer on your own. Write a new implementation of this class that 
 * implements the constructors and methods shown in Figure 8-5. The only aspect of the design that you donâ€™t yet know how to 
 * implement is the feature in which calling nextToken when no tokens are available generates an error. To get around that problem, 
 * write your version of nextToken so that it returns null if no additional tokens exist.

/*
Constructor
new StringTokenizer(String str)
Creates a new StringTokenizer object that reads whitespace-separated tokens from str
new StringTokenizer(String str, String delims)
Creates a StringTokenizer that uses the characters in delims as token delimitators.
new StringTokenizer(String str, String delims, boolean returnDelims)
Creates a StringTokenizer that returns delimiters as tokens if the third argument is true.

Methods to read tokens from the token stream
boolean hasMoreTokens()
Returns true if there are more tokens to read from this StringTokenizer.
String nextToken()
Returns the next token from the token stream, signaling an error if no tokens remain.
