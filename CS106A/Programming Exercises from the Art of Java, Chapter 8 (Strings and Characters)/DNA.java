 * 	The generic code for all living organisms is carried in its DNA -a molecule with the remarkable capacity to replicate its own 
 * structure. The DNA molecule itself consists of a long strand of chemical bases wound together with a similar molecule to form 
 * a double helix pattern. DNAâ€™s ability to replicate comes from the fact that the four bases in 
 * its structure -adenosine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine- combine with each other only in the following ways:
 * 		- Adenosine links only with thymine, and vice versa.
 * 		- Cytosine links only with guanine, and vice versa.
 * Typically, biologists abbreviate the names of the bases so that each is represented by its initial letter: A, C, G, or T.
 * 	Inside the cell, a DNA strands acts as a template to which other DNA strands can attach themselves. As an example, suppose that you have the following DNA strand, in which the position of each base has been numbered as it would be in a Java string:
 * 
 * 		T	A	A	C	G	G	T	A	C	G	T	C
 * 		|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|
 * 		_____________________________________________
 * 		0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11
 * 
 * One of the problems that biologists need to solve is finding where a short SNA strand can attach itself to a longer one. 
 * f , for example, you are trying to find a math for the strand.
 *	   		__________________
 *	   		|	|	|	|	|
 *	   		T	T	G	C	C
 * 
 * the rules for DNA replication dictate that this strand can bind to the longer one at position 1:
 *			__________________
 *			|	|	|	|	|
 *			T	T	G	C	C
 *		T	A	A	C	G	G	T	A	C	G	T	C
 *		|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|
 *		_____________________________________________
 *		0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11
 *
 * Write a method findFirstMatchingPosition(shortDNA, longDNA) that takes tow strings of letters representing the bases in DNA 
 * strands. The method should return the first index position at which the first DNA stand would bind onto the second, or -1 
 * if no matching position exists.
