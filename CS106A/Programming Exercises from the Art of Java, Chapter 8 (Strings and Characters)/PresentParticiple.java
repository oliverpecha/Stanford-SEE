 *  In English, the notion of a present action that is continuing into the future is expressed using the present progressive tense, which involves 
 *  the addition of an ing suffix to the verb. For example, the sentence I think conveys a sense that one is capable of thinking; by contrast, the 
 *  sentence I am thinking conveys the impression that one is actually in the process of thinking. The ing form of the verb is called the present 
 *  participle.
 *  Unfortunately, creating the present participle is not always as simple as adding the ing ending. One common exception is words that end in a 
 *  silent e, such as cogitate. In such cases, the e is usually dropped, so that the participle form becomes cogitating. Another common exception 
 *  involves words that end with a single consonant, which typically gets doubled in the participle form. For example, the verb program becomes 
 *  programming.
 *  Although there are many exceptions, you can construct a large fraction of the legal participle forms in English by applying the following rules:
 *  	a. If the word ends in an e preceded by a consonant, take the e away before adding the ing suffix. Thus, move should become moving. If the 
 *  	e is not preceded by a consonant, it should remain in place, so that see becomes seeing.
 *  	b. If the word ends in a consonant preceded by a vowel, insert an extra copy of that consonant before adding the ing suffix. Thus, jam should 
 *  	become jamming. If, however, there is more than one consonant at the end of the word, no such doubling takes place, so that walk becomes walking.
 *  	c. In all other circumstances, simply add the ing suffix.
 *  Write a method presentParticiple that takes an English verb, which you may assume is entirely lowercase and at least two characters long, and forms 
 *  the participle using these rules. Write a ConsoleProgram to test your method
