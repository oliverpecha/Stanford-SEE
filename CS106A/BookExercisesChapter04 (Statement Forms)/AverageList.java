 * This file solves problem 6 on chapter 4 of Programming Exercises from the Art of Java.
 * Using the AddIntegerList program from Figure 4-5 as a model, write a program called AverageList 
 * that reads in a list of integers representing exam scores and then prints out the average. 
 * Because some unfortunate student might actually get a score of 0, your program should use â€“1 
 * as the sentinel to mark the end of the input.
