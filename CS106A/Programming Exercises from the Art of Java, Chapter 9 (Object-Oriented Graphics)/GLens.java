 * Define a new Glens class to represent a convex lens that looks something like this:
 * Geometrically, the lens is formed by the intersection of two somewhat larger circles as you cans ee from this diagram:
 * The radius of each circle is a function of the width and height of the lens. You can easily work out the relationship by 
 * using the Pythagorean Theorem along with a little algebra; to save you trouble, the formula for the radius r is:
 * r = h(2) + w(2) / 4w
 * Once you know the radius, you can calculate the location of the center of each circle by using the geometrical relationship 
 * shown in the following diagram:
 * In terms of the implementation, the GLens class should extend GPolygon and use the addArc method to construct the outline. 
 * The Constructor should take the width and height of the lens as parameters. To compute the angle â€˜0, you can either use 
 * trigonometry or call the GMath.angle method shown in Figure 9-5. Write a test program that draws several lenses on the display, 
 * using different values for the width and height of each lens.
