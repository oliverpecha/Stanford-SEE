/*
 * File: sqrt.cpp
 * --------------
 * Even though clients of the <cmath> library typically donâ€™t need to understand how functions
 * like sqrt work internally, the implementers of that library have to be able to design an
 * effective algorithm and write the necessary code. If you were asked to implement the sqrt
 * function without using the library version, there are many strategies you could adopt.
 * One of the easiest strategies to understand is successive approximation in which you make a
 * guess at the solution and then refine that guess by choosing new values that move closer to the solution.
 *
 * You can use successive approximation to determine the square root of x by adopting the following strategy:
 *      1. Begin by guessing that the square root is x / 2. Call that guess g.
 *      2. The actual square root must lie between g and x / g. At each step in the successive approximation,
 *      generate a new guess by averaging g and x / g.
 *      3. Repeat step 2 until the values g and x / g are as close together as the machine precision allows.
 *      In C++, the best way to check for this condition is to test whether the average is equal to either
 *      of the values used to generate it.
 *
 *      Use this strategy to write your own implementation of the sqrt function.
