/*
 * File: RadioActiveDecay.cpp
 * --------------
 * A radioactive atom, for example, does not decay for any specific reason that we mortals understand. Instead,
 * that atom has a random probability of decaying within a period of time. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnâ€™t,
 * and there is no way to know for sure.
 *
 * Because physicists consider radioactive decay a random process, it is not surprising that random numbers
 * can be used to simulate it. Suppose you start with a collection of atoms, each of which has a certain probability
 * of decaying in any unit of time. You can then approximate the decay process by taking each atom in turn and
 * deciding randomly whether it decays, considering the probability.
 *
 * Write a program that simulates the decay of a sample that contains 10,000 atoms of radioactive material,
 * where each atom has a 50 percent chance of decaying in a year. The output of your program should show the number
 * of atoms remaining at the end of each year, which might look something like this:
 *
 * As the numbers indicate, roughly half the atoms in the sample decay each year. In physics, the conventional way
 * to express this observation is to say that the sample has a half-life of one year.
