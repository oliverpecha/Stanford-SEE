 * File: Roll.cpp
 * --------------
 * The figures in this book are created using PostScriptÂ®, a powerful graphics language developed by
 * the Adobe Corporation in the early 1980s. PostScript programs store their data on a stack.
 * Many of the operators available in the PostScript language have the effect of manipulating the
 * stack in some way. You can, for example, invoke the pop operator, which pops the top element off
 * the stack, or the exch operator, which swaps the top two elements.
 *
 * One of the most interesting (and surprisingly useful) PostScript operators is the roll operator,
 * which takes two arguments: n and k. The effect of applying roll(n, k) is to rotate the top n elements
 * of a stack by k positions, where the general direction of the rotation is toward the top of the stack.
 * More specifically, roll(n, k) has the effect of removing the top n elements, cycling the top element
 * to the last position k times, and then replacing the reordered elements back on the stack.
 *
 * Figure 5-14 shows before and after pictures for three different examples of roll.
 *
 *  image
 *
 * Write a function
 *            void roll(Stack<char> & stack, int n, int k)
 * that implements the roll(n, k) operation on the specified stack. Your implementation should check that
 * n and k are both nonnegative and that n is not larger than the stack size; if either of these
 * conditions is violated, your implementation should call error with the message
 *
 *         roll: argument out of range
 *
 * Note, however, that k can be larger than n, in which case the roll operation continues through more than
 * a complete cycle. This case is illustrated in the final example in Figure 5-14, in which the top
 * two elements on the stack are rolled four times, leaving the stack exactly as it started.
