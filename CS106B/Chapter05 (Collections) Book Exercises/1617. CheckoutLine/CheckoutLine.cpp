 * File: CheckoutLine.cpp
 * ----------------------
 * 16. The checkout-line simulation in Figure 5-5 can be extended to investigate important
 * practical questions about how waiting lines behave. As a first step, rewrite the simulation
 * so that there are several independent queues, as is usually the case in supermarkets.
 * A customer arriving at the checkout area finds the shortest checkout line and enters that queue.
 * Your revised simulation should calculate the same results as the simulation in the chapter.
 *
 * 17. As a second extension to the checkout-line simulation, change the program from the previous
 * exercise so that there is a single waiting line served by multiple cashiersâ€”a practice that has
 * become more common in recent years. In each cycle of the simulation, any cashier that becomes
 * idle serves the next customer in the queue. If you compare the data produced by this exercise
 * and the preceding one, what can you say about the relative advantages of these two strategies?
*/

/*
 * This program simulates a checkout line, such as one you
 * might encounter in a grocery store. Customers arrive at
 * the checkout stand and get in line. Those customers wait
 * in the line until the cashier is free, at which point
 * they are served and occupy the cashier for some period
 * of time. After the service time is complete, the cashier
 * is free to serve the next customer in the line.
 *
 * In each unit of time, up to the constant SIMULATION_TIME,
 * the following operations are performed:
 *
 * 1. Determine whether a new customer has arrived.
 *   New customers arrive randomly, with a probability
 *   determined by the constant ARRIVAL_PROBABILITY.
 *
 * 2. If the cashier is busy, note that the cashier has
 *   spent another minute with that customer. Eventually,
 *   the customer's time request is satisfied, which frees
 *   the cashier.
 *
 * 3. If the cashier is free, serve the next customer in line.
 *   The service time is taken to be a random period between
 *   MIN_SERVICE_TIME and MAX_SERVICE_TIME.
 *
 * At the end of the simulation, the program displays the
 * simulation constants and the following computed results:
 *
 * o The number of customers served
 * o The average time spent in line
 * o The average number of people in line
