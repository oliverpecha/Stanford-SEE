 * --------------
 * As mathematical historians have told the story, the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss
 * (1777-1855) began to show his mathematical talent at a very early age. When he was in elementary school,
 * Gauss was asked by his teacher to compute the sum of the numbers between 1 and 100. Gauss is said to have
 * given the answer instantly: 5050. Write a program that computes the answer to the question Gaussâ€™s teacher posed.
