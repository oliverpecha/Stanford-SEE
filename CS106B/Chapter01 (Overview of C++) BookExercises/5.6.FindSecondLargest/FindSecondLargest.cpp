/*
 * File: main.cpp
 * --------------
 * BWrite a program that reads in a list of integers from the user until the user enters the
 * value 0 as a sentinel. When the sentinel appears, your program should display the largest
 * value in the list, as illustrated in the following sample run:
 *
 * Be sure to define the sentinel value as a constant in a way that makes it easy to change.
 * You should also make sure that the program works correctly if all the input values are negative.
 *
 * For a slightly more interesting challenge, write a program that finds both the largest and the
 * second-largest number in a list, prior to the entry of a sentinel. Once again using 0 as the
 * sentinel, a sample run of this program might look like this:
 *
 * The values in this sample run are the number of pages in the British hardcover editions of
 * J. K. Rowlingâ€™s Harry Potter series. The output therefore tells us that the longest book
 * (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) has 766 pages and the second-longest book
 * (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) weighs in at a mere 636 pages.
