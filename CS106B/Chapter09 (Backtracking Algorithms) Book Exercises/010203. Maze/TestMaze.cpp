/*

 * --------------
 * 01. In many mazes, there are multiple paths. For example, Figure 9-7 shows three solutions for
 * the same maze. None of these solutions, however, is optimal. The shortest path through the maze has a path length of 11:
 * Write a function
 *            int shortestPathLength(Maze & maze, Point start);
 * that returns the length of the shortest path in the maze from the specified position to any exit. If there is no solution,
 * shortestPathLength should return â€“1.
