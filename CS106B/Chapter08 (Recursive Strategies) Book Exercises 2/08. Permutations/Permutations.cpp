 * 8. The recursive decomposition presented in section 8-3 to solve the problem of generating permutations is not the
 * only effective strategy. Another way to look at the problem is to solve the recursive case looks like this:
 * a) Remove the first character from the string and store it in the variable ch.
 * b) Generate the set containing all permutations of the remaining characters.
 * c) Form a new set by inserting ch in every possible position in each of those permutations.
 * Reimplement the Permutations program so that it uses this new strategy.
 *
 * 9. The strategy used to implement the Permutations program in the text is designed to emphasize its recursive
 * character. The resulting code is not particularly efficient, mostly because it ends up generating sets that are
 * later discarded and because it applies methods like substr that require copying the characters in a string. It
 * is possible to eliminate those inefficiencies using the following recursive formulation:
 *
 * a) At each level, pass the entire string along with an index that indicates where the permutation process starts.
 * Characters in the string before this index stay where they are; characters at or after that position must go through
 * all their permutations.
 * b) The simple case occurs when the index reaches the end of the string.
 * c) The recursive case operates by swapping the character at the index position with every other character in the string
 * and then generating every permutation starting with the next higher index and then swapping the characters back to
 * ensure that the original order is restored.
 *
 * Use this strategy to implement a function
 *
 *           void listPermutations(string str);
 *
 * that lists on cout all permutations of the string str without generating any sets at all or applying any string
 * methods other than length or selection. The listPermutations function itself must be a wrapper function for a second
 * function that includes the index.
 * This function is relatively easy to implement if you donâ€™t try to take account of duplicated letters in the string.
 * The interesting challenge comes in adapting the structure of the algorithm so that it lists each unique permutation
 * exactly once without using sets to accomplish that task. You should not, however, worry about the order in which
 * listPermutations delivers its output.
