 * File: isSentencePalindrome.cpp
 * --------------
 * The concept of a palindrome is often extended to full sentences by ignoring punctuation
 * and differences in the case of letters. For example, the sentence Madam, Iâ€™m Adam. is a sentence palindrome,
 * because if you only look at the letters and ignore any distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters,
 * it reads identically backward and forward.
 *
 * Write a predicate function isSentencePalindrome(str) that returns true if the string str fits this definition
 * of a sentence palindrome. For example, you should be able to use your function to write a main program capable
 * of producing the following sample run:
